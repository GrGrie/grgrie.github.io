I am excited to announce that my application for the Research Assistant (HiWi) position at RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau has been approved! I look forward to contributing to cutting-edge research in machine learning and computer vision under the guidance of  [Naghmeh Ghanooni](https://ml.cs.rptu.de/people/naghmeh-ghanooni.php). Stay tuned for updates on my research projects and findings!
