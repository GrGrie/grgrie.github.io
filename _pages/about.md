Hi, I'm a M.Sc. student at RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau and a research assistant under the supervision of [Naghmeh Ghanooni](https://ml.cs.rptu.de/people/naghmeh-ghanooni.php). My work focuses on a variety of methods to improve computer vision robustness, covering synthetic data generation, data selection, feature-space analysis, and mitigating **spurious correlations**.

I train and evaluate large-scale self-supervised and contrastive models, integrate diverse datasets into custom pipelines, and design reproducible multi-run experiments. Beyond research, I bring solid software engineering and ML systems experience, from dataset curation and augmentation to building scalable, reliable training and deployment workflows.
